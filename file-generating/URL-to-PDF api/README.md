# URL-to-PDF API

This page will demonstrate an example of packaging a service into a container and running it. The service we will be packaging is an API server that converts a web page into a PDF,i.e., can convert any URL or HTML content to a PDF file or an image (PNG/JPEG) and can be found [here](https://github.com/alvarcarto/url-to-pdf-api).This service is useful when you need to automatically produce PDF files for receipts, weekly reports, invoices, or any other type of content.
